Вам сейчас нужно получить гражданство - это главное. И вот узнайте: у вас же трое детей, вы многодетная семья, вам обязательно будет положены какие-то плюшки, узнавайте , не стесняйтесь. Про материнский капитал обязательно узнайте, на третьего тоже что-то дают. Было бы совсем не плохо получить помощь от государства.

И тем более областного города.<br />Мол, ну что вы ( обиженно так..) снимаете всё по дворам, да по окраинам. Вот вы снимите площадь перед областной администрацией, у нас там чистенько и уютненько) или у мэрии. <br />Или вот нашу ( тут может быть любое название, в каждом городе оно своё) местную Рублёвку, там<br />домики все такие красивые, а плитка тротуарная просто сказочная, с самой Европы завезенная, от жары и морозов не трескается и выдерживает до 10 тонн на квадратный метр. :)))<br />Не везде нормальная власть и не всем повезло с нормальным губернатором и мэром... Скажем, бываю я периодически в городе Белгород ( мама туда с севера  лет 11 назад переехала) и вижу, что лет 15 здесь точно есть Хозяин с большой буквы.  Причём, как в области, так и в областном центре. А вот есть регионы и города, где этого не скажешь, к сожалению.<br />По поводу старых домов. Так в этих домах есть душа! Как то раньше строили, что вот дом и ты прямо<br />его чувствуешь! Я обожаю двухэтажные дома. Вот в Магадане двухэтажные дома сносят. Их почти не осталось.<br />Каждый снесённый дом отзывался болью в моём сердце.  Ладно бы на их месте строили какие то красивые, неповторимые, как в Белгороде, , где каждый новый ансамбль домов не похож на соседний, ато понастроили такие убожества, просто ужас. И даже порой нет краски, что бы это уродство хотя бы сделать<br />не таким страшным по цвету.<br /> Не серым,  а более менее позитивным, что ли. И это на севере, где итак то большую часть года всё бело-чёрно-серое. Зима... Я, честно говоря, не понимаю, что творится в архитектуре. Я бы на законодательном уровне просто запретил бы строить убожества. Строишь жильё или какое то здание для офиса или производства?<br />Будь любезен сделать его красивым, удобным, с всей инфраструктурой, архитектурно выверенным и согласованным с местным архитектором, который, в свою очередь, должен иметь представление, что такое красиво а что нет и так далее.  Судя по тому, что построено за последние лет 15 в разных города страны, где я бываю, видимо понимание красоты бывает кардинально разное :))) Ну, хотя бы здание должно быть в стиле местного города, местного духа или наоборот его улучшать. Но порой не быть, как кусок дерьма на паркете.<br />Или вот бывает, строят дома. С виду то вроде и красивые и удобные. Но их так понатыкают друг на друга, что люди в них, как в тюрьме. Ни по диагонали как то через определённое расстояние, ни по какому либо ещё грамотному принципу, а лишь что бы каждый метр земли был занят. В итоге люди порой даже штор не открывают, потому что там кроме стены буквально напротив стоящего дома через 20-30 метров ничего не увидишь. И это новые районы! Мол, вы же хотели жильё, так получите!<br />У меня так знакомые попали в том городе, где я сейчас живу. ( Великий Новгород)<br /> Когда они купили жильё тут года три назад в отдалённом, но перспективном районе города ,<br />то наивно полагали, что совесть то у городских властей то есть и они в любом случае при дальнейшей застройке территории напротив их дома оставят хоть кусочек вида реки, леса, поля.<br /> Всё таки окраина города, новый район, будет дальше развиваться, мол хоть какие то плюсы и тут должны же быть. <br />Ага! &quot;ЩАЗ!&quot; :))  Буквально через год прямо напротив их построили 7 или 8 подъездную &quot;китайскую стену&quot;, да ещё высотную, перекрывающую и небо с солнцем в том числе, не говоря уж о речке, кусочке леса и поле, и они теперь в страшном унынии, хоть продавай квартиру и ищи новую. Это жесть! 0_0  Это же надо так уродовать город и ненавидеть людей, для которых вы строите. В том числе и о коррумпированности местных властей это говорит, главный  архитектор тут не исключение.  Не один нормальный честный архитектор на такое разрешение бы никогда не дал, как я это понимаю.<br />P.S. И проходишь между таких домов, где понатыкали так, что ужас и думаешь, уж лучше бы здесь старые двухэтажечки стояли. Те хоть так не давили!<br />Помню, как на Чёрной Речке ( район так в Питере называется) стоял и любовался просто старым двухэтажным домом, с такой какой-то интересной арочкой на входе в единственное парадное. И такой тёплый, жёлто- бежевый, приятный цвет.<br />И судя по окнам и машинам у подъезда, понял, что просто этому дому повезло с жильцами или с одним из них, кто понимает истинную цену старой красивой архитектуры.  Пусть где то строгой, где то изысканной, но в целом очень гармоничной и радующей глаз.<br /> Деревья рядом, которым уже лет по 200-300, не меньше. Но я смотрел на этот дом и с грустью понимал, что в следующий мой приезд с Великого Новгорода или ещё тогда с Магадана, точнее,  к питерским друзьям, я могу этот прекрасный островочек старой архитектуры не увидеть, а вместо него, на 99% уверен в этом, будет построено очередное абсолютно безликое здание, на которое даже взгляд кинуть не захочешь, а лишь подальше от него быстрее несёт, так как оно на тебя давит и это единственное чувство, если не считать отвращения...<br />По Воронежу. Смотрю, город большой, интересный, с богатой историей и есть что посмотреть.<br />Где то под Воронежем у меня двоюродный брат с семьёй живёт, который туда с Алма-Алты, с Казахстана, лет 8-10, как переехал.

Добрый вечер вам всем!!! =) ))) Я хочу сказать вам одну единственную вещь!!! Слушайте внимательно, и, ВНИКАЙТЕ!!! Без Украины, Россия, просто-напросто, не сможет существовать!!! Без Украины Россия – «недоимперия»!!! А то, и, не империя вовсе!!! Вам, пидорасам, портить с нами отношения совершенно НИ К ЧЕМУ!!! Подумайте своими «ватными» мозгами!!! А также, проанализируйте все те поступки, которые вы совершили по отношению к Украине!!! Ни для кого не секрет, что украинская тема стала для российской жизни, так называемой, «рутиной»!!! Более того, украинские события давно уже вытеснили российскую политику!!! Которая, фактически, «само-аннигилировалась»!!! Либо, стала реакцией на происходящее в Украине!!! Продолжается бесконечный процесс «Минского примирения»!!! Который, что называется, превратился в «виртуальность»!!! И, с этой виртуальностью все смирились!!! Ибо, не может быть «нормального» выхода из войны, в которой противники – Россия, и, Украина – преследуют несовместимые интересы!!! «Минск-2», на данный момент, стал поиском путей замораживания конфликта!!! И, пока идет мучительное прощупывание возможных условий его «заморозки»!!! Но!!! Даже если участники этой безнадежной виртуальной затеи найдут компромисс, то, я вас уверяю, он будет неизбежно временным!!! Только и всего!!! Стремление Кремля подорвать жизнеспособность государства, которое он считает частью «Русской системы», а украинцев, и, русских – одним народом, означает воспроизводство состояния «ни мира – ни войны»!!! Оно, неизбежно, будет «кровоточить»!!! И, в любой момент, способно, просто-напросто, взорваться!!! Как это происходит, например, в другой ситуации!!! Где нет «ни мира, ни войны»!!! Это, как известно, нагорный Карабах!!! Украина стала для России так называемым, «переломным» фактором,!!! Который, открыл новую страницу в российской истории!!! Украина, некогда, «бриллиант» в короне русского самодержавия, нанесла смертельный удар по «Русской системе»!!! Она решила двинуться в Европу!!! То есть, выбрать враждебный для Москвы цивилизационный вектор!!! Это есть подрыв самодержавного «генетического кода»!!! Который, зиждется на имперскости!!! Украина – это, важнейший ее элемент!!! Роль, и, значимость Украины для самодержавия в Кремле понимали всегда!!! С особым остервенением уничтожая все намеки на украинское национальное самосознание!!! Сталин решился на геноцид украинской нации!!! Для того, чтобы истребить в зародыше ее стремление к национальному духу!!! Повторяю: без Украины Россия – «недоимперия»!!! А то, и, не империя вовсе. И, нынешний Кремль это прекрасно понимает!!! И, осознает!!! И, абсолютно неважно, на каком уровне!!! Уровне ощущений, либо, уровне логики!!! Недаром Украина стала личным проектом Путина!!! Украина не стала непосредственным поводом для возвращения Кремля к модели «Крепость-Россия»!!! Это возвращение было реакцией на российские протесты 2011-2012 годов!!! И, следствием неспособности Кремля править в ситуации «полуоткрытой форточки»!!! То есть, мягкого авторитаризма!!! А, падение Виктора Януковича стало для Кремля одновременно, и, ударом, и, подарком!!! Он дал повод для перевода доктрины «Россия – Крепость» из лозунга в практическую плоскость через «крымнашизм»!!! Сопротивление Украины , а также, упорство Украины в выборе своего пути на Запад – это самое явное, и, откровенное доказательство неспособности России вернуться к традиционной модели самодержавия!!! Эта модель обязательно должна включать Украину!!! Но!!! Ирония заключается в том, что превращение украинской темы в фактор российской внутренней политики, а также, ключевую составляющую легитимации Кремля, говорит, просто-напросто, об отсутствии у «Русской системы» иных механизмов жизнеспособности!!! Россия стала заложницей украинского вектора!!! В каком-то смысле, сегодня украинцы покорили Россию!!! Точно так же, как они сделали это в культурном, и, интеллектуальном смысле!!! Когда оказались в имперских объятиях Москвы!!! У украинцев уже было Магдебургское право!!! Они были образованнее московитов!!! И, даже первый русский толковый словарь создал украинец в Киеве!!!

И ладно, иду дальше; так взять хотя бы то, когда Директор, за всю Историю ЦРУ, Джордж Тенет, впервые, Инкогнито, 15 августа 2000 года посетил Россию! Так и Советский Союз, ни один Директор, ни при каких ситуациях, никогда не посещал! Да-да, впервые, когда американская субмарина Мемфис... торпедировала Гордость Российского флота, АПЛ-Курск!

И вот тогда, в той долго-часовой встрече-беседе, на третий день трагедии, Фальшивый Президент, уже окончательно, по договорённости, продал Курск вместе с душами мужественных моряков за 10 млрд. долларов... Вот с тех пор, малость позже, Изменник, Играя на Публику, понарошку, направо и налево хаит Америку, набирая хвалёные балы перед Простоватым-Доверчивым Народом... И как бы всё это горько ни было, но состоявшийся ИУДА, ни тогда, ни сегодня, не был настоящим МУЖЧИНОЙ!!, в полном смысле этого слова. Ибо до встречи с Директором, Прохвост, вёл телефонные переговоры с Биллом <br />Клинтоном, при которых, будь он Мужчиной, то поставил бы УЛЬТИМАТУМ: или неизбежная война, или Контрибуция, на определённых условиях, о чём через час я и ставлю всё народонаселение России в известность! А ещё через час, не услышав ответа, приступаю к отмщению за военных подводников с неповторимого Курска!!!

Так и сам Гебон Гебонович перед собственным народом не мог тянуть на Героя! По существу, ещё до Курска, он уже... стал ИСЧАДИЕМ АДА!!!...

Не нужны были попы, цари и чиновники, была горизонтальная система власти. Это длилось многие тысячи лет. После оккупации еврейской идеологией, Русь нагнули и ввели вертикальную систему власти, где вверху стал командовать царь, а внизу опричники. Народ превратился в рабов, сначало в божьих, а потом по сути. <br /><br />Вертикальная система власти, это еврейское изобретение, которое можно назвать глобализмом, где народ бесправен и подчиняется верхушке избранных.<br /><br />Горизонтальная система власти, это славянская традиция, где народ самостоятельно управляет своей жизнью, подчиняясь Праву (Конституции).<br /><br />Проще говоря, в вертикальной системе власти жизнь народа зависит от того, кто сидит наверху и какие законы рисует. Хороший царь - хорошо живет народ, плохой царь - плохо. Все зависит от одного человека. А в горизонтальной системе власти, жизнь народа определяется Правом, на основе родовой приемственности поколений, и не зависит от одной личности. Здесь каждый человек ответственнен перед собой, Правом (Конституцией) и людьми, которые его окружают.<br /><br />Соединение двух систем власти приводит к образному кресту, который означает противодействие и смуту в обществе. Две такие системы всегда противодействуют к друг другу. Примеров таких масса, как бунты, революции, перевороты и гражданские войны.<br /><br />Сейчас преобладает вертикальная система власти совместно с жалким подобием горизонтали, где верхи уже не могут управлять, а низы не хотят подчиняться. Это так долго продолжаться не может, ибо русский бунт будет страшен и беспощаден.<br /><br />К чему надо стремиться? Нужно стемиться к тому, чтобы горизонтальная система власти, а это самоуправление, превальировала над вертикальной. Чтобы вертикальная система была вспомогательной горизонтальной системы власти, а не основной.<br /><br />Обратите внимание, что в экономически развитых странах преобладает малый бизнес, а не глобальный, в виде корпораций и монополий. Малый бизнес приводит к высокой конкуренции, следовательно, повышается качество и рентабельность товара и услуг. Аналогия простая - малый бизнес это горизонталь экономики, а вертикаль - это глобализм, корпорации и монополии.<br /><br />Так же и в обществе, должна быть диктатура Права (Конституции), а не чиновники.'),(3961,'ii4KR3B8B9s','Правильные слова'),(3962,'ii4KR3B8B9s','Вот НАСТОЯЩИЙ  человек'),(3963,'ii4KR3B8B9s','Про Путина правду сказал.

Сколько нас в России ?<br />– Приближается к 62 миллионам человек.<br />------- <br />За что убрали Екатерину Улитину.<br />Екатерина Улитина, сотрудница Центрального Аналитического Центра отдела ЗАГСа, рассказала всему миру о том, что по данным ЗАГС на 1 июня 2010 года — в Российской Федерации по документам числится живого населения всего 89 654 325 человек, а не 142 000 000, как было заявлено официально в переписи населения. Екатерина Улитина даже привела настоящую статистику: «За весь 2009 год умерло 5 000 854 человека. А за период с 01.01.2010 г. до 1 июня 2010 года умерло уже 4 678 856 человек. Правительство знает об этом, ведь каждый квартал правительство фиксирует наши отчёты ЦАЦ РФ, но реально оно обнародует совсем другие цифры. Более того, в течение 10-15 лет в России ожидается смертность около 40 000 000 человек!» <br />После того, как она открыла всем эти страшные факты о реальном количестве живых россиян, её уволили из Центрального Аналитического Центра отдела ЗАГСа. После увольнения её немедленно подтянули в одну известную организацию. Там вежливые люди очень вежливо посоветовали Екатерине впредь держать свой язык за зубами.<br />Таким образом, Россия вымирает не от числа 142 миллионов человек, а от 89 миллионов человек. Как говорится, почувствуйте разницу.<br />Факт сокрытия чудовищного по масштабам умерщвления людей указывает на умышленное создание таких жизненных условий, которые рассчитаны на полное физическое уничтожение населения России, в основном русских.<br />Время прошло. Цифры увеличились. Сначала по 5 млн в год, потом за полгода, как мы видим в 2010 – за полгода почти 5 млн чел. Значит за год 10 млн? Но эти цифры уже никто не озвучивает. Получается, если в год умирает по 10 млн, с 2010, то сколько же нас осталось? Меньше чем 42 млн?<br />Мир равнодушен, в чем его нельзя упрекнуть – слишком много бед натворила страна Россия.

Муж Алексей,жена Марина и их двое прекрасных малышей.Открыли продуктовый магазинчик. Раз в неделю, в субботу, загружают свой автомобильчик и едут в соседнюю деревню для торговли потому как деревня относительно большая а магазина нет. Вот что хочу отметить. Все просьбы жителей Марина как хозяйка магазина всегда выполняет по полной программе,аккуратно все записывает и привозит с базы. Для животных привозит товар без наценки,отказывается наценивать. Мелкие заказы жителей ( заказы на те товары которых вообще не бывает в магазине) тоже без наценки. Даже силком ничего свыше цены базы не берет. Трудится практически весь световой день. Когда ее нет на месте всегда можно прийти к ней домой и она быстро собирается и бежит отпускать товар. Естественно всегда рядом и помогает ей ее муж Алексей.  Вся округа практически молится на нее. Всегда добрая,никогда никому не откажет ни в чем, всегда отпустит товар в долг если нет денег ( до зарплаты или до пенсии) . Гоняет местных алкашей,никогда им не дает в долг ( и правильно делает ). Никогда за все время, а это уже три года, ни разу никаких конфликтов, никаких даже намеков на конфликты. Новый год всегда празднуем всеми соседними тремя деревнями. Ставим елку,накрываем общественные столы, как всегда магнитофон,усилитель,колонки и до утра веселимся,поем,танцуем,разговариваем. Разговоры и слухи о каких то конфликтах между нашими братскими народами может быть имеют место где то,но у нас никогда таковых не возникало. Так что Олег не падайте духом, все будет нормально для тех людей которые трудятся . Сейчас везде буквально,во всем мире творится бог знает что. Моя бывшая жена живет с сыном в Токио и такое рассказывает что думаю даже нашим чиновникам такое не снится в страшном сне. В Японии та же проблема - деревни рассыпаются,умирают. Молодежь разбегается,не хочет работать, не хочет учиться. Теряются все хваленые японские традиции, теряется преемственность поколений в профессиях. Ужас творится после Фукусимы, иностранные бизнесмены разбежались кто куда, уже нет таких легендарных зарплат, все очень дорого..... Бюрократия и идиотизм доказывается тем что деревни которые не были подвергнуты радиоактивным осадкам - получают дотации и с точностью до наоборот - деревни на которые выпали осадки ничего не получают. Вам это ничего не напоминает ? Не знаю куда мир катится. Да не то что катится,стремительно падает в пропасть. Так что всем надо крепиться,держаться и совершенствовать жизнь к лучшему.

Вот она идея, вот она честь и достоинство. Не за могарыч отдать жизнь, а за свободу. Сегодня многие ноют, как им тяжело в России, а вот за границей живут в шоколаде. И легко найти виновного в своих бедах, но тяжелее изменить себя. Хотят, чтобы чиновники не воровали, хотя сами будь на их месте тоже не отказались бы от халявы. Начинать необходимо с себя. Когда в обществе коррупция, воровство, ложь, разврат будут громко и открыто порицаемы, тогда и люди изменятся.

Образцы генетического материала дочерей Путина были получены ранее, во время их зарубежных поездок. Также, ранее взятые образцы (2007-2008 г.) генетического материала Российского лидера — не совпадают с нынешними образцами, и, следовательно, роль Владимира Путина на публике играет неустановленное лицо. Ранее экспертами и многочисленными СМИ отмечалось, что лица Владимира Путина на фотографиях и видеоматериалах, даже сделанных с очень коротким интервалом времени — заметно различны. В настоящее время на заседании Бидельбергского Клуба рассматривается вопрос, каким образом следует сформулировать отношение к неизвестному персонажу Российской политики — «якобы лидеру и президенту». Является ли он заместителем, либо иначе уполномоченным лицом, и какова истинная судьба легитимного президента — в настоящий момент не ясно. Бывшая жена президента России Людмила Путина заявила о его убийстве. Об этом она сказала в интервью одному из самых влиятельных изданий Германии, передает Clutch. Женщина утверждает, что теперь боится за свою жизнь и жизнь детей. «Моего мужа, к сожалению, уже давно нет в живых. Я вынуждена признаться в этом публично, потому что не могу больше видеть, что творится от его имени. Это страшные люди. Они не перед чем не остановятся.

В каждой такой группе, есть психолог и аналитик. Используют, специально заготовленную и искаженную, но с виду правдивую информацию. Переспорить их<br />попросту невозможно, они при споре скопом набрасываются на Вас и создают иллюзию,<br />что недовольных в России большинство.<br /><br />Смысл их постов заключается в том, что в них будет осуждаться и искажаться всё, что происходит в России. Например, олимпиада представляется, как показушное мероприятие, направленное на растранжиривание финансовых госсредств. Вас постоянно будут настраивать на то, что олимпиада проведена<br />для&quot;поднятия авторитета Путина&quot; в мире. Вам будут приводиться финзатраты на олимпиаду и полную их неокупаемость, разрушаемость олимпийских<br />объектов и т.д. <br /><br />Аналогично будет осуждаться все, что делается в стране: дороги, новые предприятия, добыча и реализация полезных ископаемых, нефти, газа, золотой<br />фондстраны, финансовой помощи Новороссии и т.д. и т.п. Все посты, обычно, будут заканчиваться призывами о консолидации общества, против нищеты народа и против Путина с его личной и богатой жизнью. <br /><br />Обязательно, частично в их постах используется и правдивая информация, но на том и держится<br />любая дезинформация! Всё, что пишут представители<br />ГОСДЕПа, профессионально сфабрикованно и специально подтасованые факты, для соцсетей России. Они используют всякие термины, как &quot;Честное государство, Нищета народа, Разворовали Россию, Зажрались Госправители&quot;.<br /><br />Затрагивается тема ЖКХ, Пенсий, Пособий, Медицина, Образование, Полиция, финансирование наших регионов и других стран, межнациональные вопросы, рост цен, судебная система, экология и т.д.<br /><br />В эту дискуссию, будут подключаться и проживающие в России - представители пятой колонны. Их цель -<br />убедить россиян в правоте их доводов и спровоцировать<br />неприязнь к власти. Госдепартамент через санкции<br />пытается создать в России социальные проблемы, чтобы обвинить в этом В.В. Путина. <br /><br />США начали информационную войну против России.

Человек существо социальное и поэтому его жизнь протекает в семье, коллективе, селе или городе - стране в целом.<br /><br />Там он получает все необходимое для своего развития. Семью, коллектив, село или город, район или область и т. д. страну в целом возглавляет отец, руководитель, глава села, города, области и страны в целом.<br /><br />Следовательно, устройство государства подобно устройству семьи. А роль главы государства подобна главе семьи, папе или маме.<br /><br />Точно так же устроены все религии мира - по патерналистскому принципу.  В счастливой полноценной семье никто не знает нужды, в ней царит СПРАВЕДЛИВОСТЬ, ИЕРАРХИЯ и ВЗАИМНАЯ ЛЮБОВЬ.<br /><br />В несчастной семье - справедливость, любовь и естественные человеческие отношения нарушены, искажены. Глава семьи становится жестоким диктатором - все члены в такой семье несчастны и не могут полноценно развиваться и жить.<br /><br />Точно так же и на уровне России - ЕЖЕЛИ ГЛАВА ГОСУДАРСТВА, ПРЕЗИДЕНТ(папа),  ЗАБОТИТСЯ О СВОЕМ НАРОДЕ, ПРЕДОСТАВЛЯЕТ ЕМУ ХОРОШО ОПЛАЧИВАЕМУЮ РАБОТУ, ЖИЛЬЕ, САДИКИ, ШКОЛЫ И БОЛЬНИЦЫ, ПОЛНОЦЕННОЕ ПИТАНИЕ И ОТДЫХ, ВЕСЬ НАБОР СОЦИАЛЬНЫХ УСЛУГ и ОБЕСПЕЧИВАЕТ ВНУТРЕННЮЮ И ВНЕШНЮЮ БЕЗОПАСНОСТЬ - то в стране  ЛАД и СПОКОЙСТВИЕ. Страна работает и развивается. Женщины, чувствуя уверенность в будущем, рожают и растят детей. НАРОД ПЛОДИТСЯ И РАЗМНОЖАЕТСЯ.  СМЕРТНОСТЬ ГОРАЗДО НИЖЕ РОЖДАЕМОСТИ.<br /><br />У Путина ровно все наоборот - он поставил Россию раком, народ вымирает, все свои провалы и неудачи внутренней жизни страны списал на внешнюю угрозу. Вдумайтесь, УГРОЗУ НОВОЙ ЯДЕРНОЙ ВОЙНЫ с США, ЗАПАДОМ В ЦЕЛОМ.<br />Он предлагает нам всем затянуть пояса на последнюю дырку и начать новую ядерную гонку, вместо того чтобы сделать Россию сильной за счет собственной экономики и реидустриализации страны.<br /><br />ПУТИН ПЛОХОЙ ОТЕЦ  СЕМЬИ МНОГОНАЦИОНАЛЬНОГО НАРОДА РОССИИ-МАТУШКИ.

Шпиёны даже могут и не знать, что другие тоже шпиёны, все знает резидент. Все странности с недопосадкой Навального разрешаются. Давно стало понятно что  на выборах ни Путину ни его ставленникам до 50 %  могут не натянуть, вот и разработали простую схему, максимально исключить из выборов граждан которые будут голосовать против путина, таким не хитрым способом, процент можно и поднять. Больше ни к какому результату  забастовка  избирателей не приведет, а тех кто за Путина  и так привезут на выборы.  ХАХАХА   Все шито белыми нитками.  и Навальному пообещали, что он станет презиком после Пу.<br /><br />Путин после 18 лет (даже больше) только собрался таргетировать бедность. ХАХАХА. Грудинин уже давно ее победил в своем ЗАО -  он огромные средства вложил в лучшие в мире школу и детский сад, обеспечил всех работников отличным жильем и достойной зарплатой, создал жизнь людей лучше, чем в развитых странах, а мог все средства потратить на виллу во Франции или резиденцию в Сочи. Чтоб мы так во всей России жили как у него в ЗАО.<br /><br />Почему, чем больше Путин правит тем все хуже и хуже?? Есть предположение - в начале пути правления Путина правительство Е. Примакова дало сильный импульс в развитии экономики России, это развитие поддержал рост цен на нефть, денег в стране стало немерено и их начали пилить с усиливающей силой. И чем дальше тем больше отпиливали и наконец стали столько отпиливать, что уже пошло массовое обнищание Россиян.  Пример - сначала сделали так, что много госкомпаний перестали или сократили платежи дивидентов в бюджет ( куда деньги - вот допустим веаланчелисту 2 млрд долл) отдали, потом друзьям и соратникам предали заказы на строительство Стадионов и мостов, выпуск учебников, тот же Платон, сейчас ХАХАХА собрались якобы для возврата капиталов выпустить Евробонды под проценты, при этом ( даже если средства вкладываемые в эти евробонды  были утаены от налогооблажения то не брать с них подоходный налог - вот ОНО - а начал Пу, что народ освободить от налоговых долгов ХАХАХА. И схема получилась отличная - не надо строить мостов и стадионов, не надо напрягать мозги управляя Платоном, просто бабло вкладываешь в Евробонды, из бюджета  России   получаешь проценты и в ус не дуешь, при этом эти деньги будут вложены в ценные бумаги США фактически без процентов.

Ленина получили право на земельную долю.<br />На основании того, что мы десятки лет работали в КСП им. Ленина нам было предоставлено право на соответствующий земельный пай.<br />Однако к настоящему времени право собственности на земельную долю было реализовано лишь в отношении двух работников КСП им. Ленина Баканова А.А. и Бобкова А.П. Указанный факт также подтверждается решением Видновского суда от 26.11.1996 года по искам работников КСП им. Ленина Баканова А.А. и Бобкова А.П.<br />В соответствии с данным решением, суд постановил выдать Баканову А.А. и Бобкову А.П. свидетельства на право собственности на 3 ГА земли в составе земель общедолевой собственности.<br />Затем главой Администрации Ленинского района Московской области было вынесено соответствующее постановление № 2468 от 10.07.1996 г., согласно которому было принято решение о выдаче указанных выше свидетельств на право собственности на земельные участки.<br />Как следует из протокола судебного заседания Видновского городского суда от 12.11.1996 года, Грудинин Павел Николаевич неизвестным образом получил свидетельства на право собственности на земельные участки, оформленные на членов трудового коллектива КСП им. Ленина с мнимой целью передачи их членам трудового коллектива. Однако Грудинин П.Н. длительное время удерживал свидетельства, объяснив свои действия тем, что свидетельства нуждаются в исправлении ошибок и потому направлены в Районный комитет по земельным ресурсам.<br />Итак, Грудинин П.Н. предоставил в Районный комитет по земельным ресурсам и иные органы исполнительной власти учредительный договор, а также протокол собрания трудового коллектива КСП им. Ленина. Исходя из документов, данное собрание проведено 13.06.1995 года, и на нем принято решение об учреждении ЗАО «Совхоз имени Ленина», принят устав, а земельные паи членов КСП им. Ленина переданы в уставной капитал образованного ЗАО «Совхоз имени Ленина» (ИНН 5003009032, ОГРН 1025000658099).'),(9202,'KQvOuW7Px04','Че продолжаем пиздеть,а как же революция ??

Так и для меня, Санкт Петербургский Теракт, за которым стоит Путин-однозначно!!! А Вы, Люди, прочтите моих эти два комментария, и тогда Вам станет всё ясно: Анисса, Вы, одну чушь накладываете на следующую чушь, а всё вместе, несёте полнейший бредовый Бред!!  Так для начала и преподношу, дабы немного Ваши мозги прочистились, а ушки, немножечко промылись: Лично для меня, Путин-ИСЧАДИЕ АДА!!! для Многострадальной Матушки-России!! Коего Псевдопрезидента и само-назначил Пьяница, Террорист-Борька. Дабы КАРАТЕЛЬ прикрыл Ельцинюге задницу, с чем Самозванец успешно и справился!.. А Сирия, это уже естественный ход ПРОВОКАТОРА, для усиления и сохранения Неограниченной ВЛАСТИ! И прекрасно понимающего, что с Украиной он попал. А здесь, ПРЕДАТЕЛЬ также &quot;пофестивалит&quot;, под Обманной эгидой Терроризма в Исламском Государстве! И вот, недалёкая, полуслепая Журналистка, будьте добры, внимайте внимательно: Вспоминаем Печально-Горькую незабываемую Дубровку 2002 года. Куда, заметим, без особых проблем добрались и ввалились в театр аж 42 чеченских, якобы, террористов. А потому всё так легко и просто без проволочек получилось, ибо ОБМАНУТОЙ ГРУППИРОВКОЙ УПРАВЛЯЛО ЭФЭСБЭ, по устному поручению НАСТОЯЩЕГО ТЕРРОРИСТА-ВЛАДИМИРА ПУТИНА!! И почему группа захвата из &quot;Альфы&quot; без всякого сожаления и размышления расстреляла уснувших молоденьких девушек и женщин-шахидок-кто-то из них, не досидели свои срока...- дабы не раскрылись КОЗНИ ГЛАВНОГО КАРАТЕЛЯ над ПРОСТОВАТЫМИ МОСКВИЧАМИ!.. Так и потому не взорвалась вся &quot;разложенная&quot; взрывчатка, ибо это был реальный МУЛЯЖ! И если, досконально просмотреть видео-бойцов спецназа, там видно, что была стопроцентная возможность рвануть всех и всё в там-тара-рам! Ведь когда любой здравомыслящий или здравомыслящая, понимают, что в этой жизни уже терять нечего, то любая или любой соединят контакт. Так и по действиям убивающих было видно, что им баре-бер до взрывчатки, или детонации, ибо они были в курсе, что всё чики-чики! Уверенно заявляю; мнимых террористов технично развели!! -А.Т. В чьём Разводе участвовал и ГЛАВАРЬ, некий АБУБАКАР, коему, как Тайному АГЕНТУ  был предоставлен последующий отход... Так и лишь после пяти дней Международного Давления на Кремль, только тогда и узнали, что был использован усыпляющий газ фентолин, предназначенный для больных раком тяжёлой формы. Вот только УБИЙЦЫ не сказали, что концентрация газа превышала норму в пять раз больше обычно используемой смеси. Так и специально, Кремлёвские Террористы, да-да, специально не предупредили о газе, как и не поставили в курс Спасателей и Медиков, как нужно действовать,в таких случаях,  дабы ЗАЛОЖНИКОВ умерло как много больше! Ведь мол могли взорвать к чёртовой матери всех 922 Заложника, а так, лишь погибло всего навсего 171 человек, чему конечно же надо радоваться, что отделались малыми потерями... А знай Проконсультированные, что уснувших ни в коем случае нельзя укладывать  на спину... дабы не проваливался язык перекрывая дыхание горла, то и наверняка цифра безвременно скончавшихся была бы намного меньше!.. К этому стоит и помнить; остальное количество бывших Мучеников спасшихся от смерти, большинство из них стали жить на лекарствах. А кто-то ослеп, кто-то оглох, кто-то сошёл с ума, а кто-то рожает детей инвалидами... И всё это, ХУЙЛО-ХУЙЛОВИЧ, делал и продолжает делать по сей день со своей БАНДОЙ, ради  НЕПРЕРЕКАЕМОЙ ВЛАСТИ!!!  И Вы, Анисса, прежде чем молоть языком, как помелом, сперва хоть тему малость прозондируйте, а затем, задумайтесь, сколь уже ГОРЯ хапнули ЛЮДИ от своего ЗЛОДЕЯ!! Так вот Анисса, внимайте дальше: Беслановская Ужасно-Ужасающая Ужасность, произошедшая  2004 года,  подготавливалась загодя КРОВАВО-ПУТИНСКИМИ ЭФЭСБЭШНИКАМИ!! Вокруг школы заблаговременно поспиливались большие деревья, дабы обзор был идеальным. Так и за три дня до искусственного ТЕРАКТА тамошняя милиция находящая совсем рядышком, огородилась бетонным забором, дабы спрятаться и ничего не видеть. Что и было в первые три сентябрьских дня, ибо, во время нависшей ОПАСНОСТИ, оттуда, так и не выбежал ни один мент! И впервые за 18 лет, вдруг первого сентября снимают ГАИшный наряд, находившийся все эти годы рядом со злополучной школой. Перенесено время проведения линейки, закрывают ближайшие детские сады, откуда снята охрана. И перед подготовляющим Терактом  меняют руководство РОВД... Так и накануне захвата обречённой, школы видели, совсем неизвестных людей. В общем, ГЕБОНЫ КОНТРОЛИРОВАЛИ СВОИХ ТЕРРОРИСТОВ!! Среди которых и было, аж восемь разных национальностей. И в чьём сброде кто-то был взят из тюрьмы, кто-то из зоны, а кто-то был и прямым агентом... ИДЕЙНЫХ, собранных среди группы, были единицы. Так даже одна из мнимых шахидок была взята из российской колонии, где и сидела за вину своего брата, коего убили как чеченского боевика. И теперь, как бывшей зэчке задурманили и без того задурманенные  мозги; мол теперь получит свободу, но пусть искупит сперва вину... И сейчас отодвинусь для продолжения комментария в соседнюю рамку.'),(9556,'MqHS4cJmpaw','Так и впоследствии бывшие ЗАЛОЖНИКИ ПОДТВЕРЖДАЛИ, ЧТО БЕСЛАНОВСКИМИ ТЕРРОРИСТАМИ РУКОВОДИЛА ГРУППА ЛЮДЕЙ СЛАВЯНСКОЙ ВНЕШНОСТИ... Кои в ночь третьего сентября покинули беспрепятственно трагедийную школу... А теперь, прикиньте; в спортивном зале учебного заведения было напихано 1116 человек, где особенно детишки изнывая от одуряющей жары, жували лепестки цветов пытаясь взять оттуда влагу. Как и сосали влажную одежду, которую им кто-то мочил, когда его, или её отпускали  напиться. Да и чего уж греха таить, дети пили даже и мочу... А федеральные каналы тем временем-улавливайте-три дня подряд &quot;чесали&quot; поганым языком лживости, что ЗАЛОЖНИКОВ ВСЕГО 354 ЧЕЛОВЕКА! Кто дружит с мозгами, те, всё поняли!! И вот, третьего сентября в тринадцать-ноль пять начинается самое страшное, неподдающееся разуму нормального человека. С крыши пятиэтажки раздаются два выстрела из огнемётов, по школе и спортивному залу! Где и раздался сдетонированный мощный взрыв, уже от настоящей, подвешенной  взрывчатке. Почему и вырвались клубы дыма наружу, создавая устрашающий пожар. И видя такую картину, войска, пока огонь больше не открывали. И тем временем, у кого была возможность, и кто мог передвигаться, покидали свой плен не раздумывая. Так и местные жители несмотря на непредсказуемую обстановку, самоотверженно спасали деток... из горящего спортзала, несмотря на стрельбу в их сторону...  А остальных Заложников,  основные Террористы сгоняли в столовую... И вот около двух часов по всей обстреливаемой школе открылся шквальный огонь из огнемётов, гранатомётов и танков, стреляющих реактивными снарядами! И кто немного разбирается, тот понимает, в каком  ОГНЕДЫШУЩИМ-ОГНЕННОМ АДУ НАХОДИЛИСЬ СТРАДАЮЩИЕ, БЕЗВИННЫЕ ДЕТКИ-ДЕТИ, ВМЕСТЕ СО ВЗРОСЛЫМИ ЗАЛОЖНИКАМИ!!  И когда всё закончилось, то к десятому сентябрю в Беслане было пропавших без вести 260 человек, а 116 тел, обугленных до неузнаваемости. И естественно, ПРОПАВШИЕ, СГОРЕЛИ ЗАЖИВО В ЖАРОВНЕ СГОРЕВШЕГО СПОРТЗАЛА!!! А Вы, люди, представьте себе хоть на минутку, какая нелепая, СТРАШНО-СТРАШНЮЧАЯ СМЕРТЬ НАСТИГЛА НИ В ЧЁМ НЕПОВИННЫХ!!!... и где, официально погибло 334 человека, из них, 186 детей!! Так и над ПЛАЧУЩИМ ГОРОДКОМ СТОЯЛ СМРАДНЫЙ СМРАД, ПРИТОРНО-СЛАДКИЙ ЗАПАХ ЧЕЛОВЕЧЕСКОГО МЯСА, И ГАРЬ-ГАРЬ КРУЖИЛА СВОЙ СКОРБНЫЙ ТАНЕЦ В НЕБЕ!!  А ИЗ ЖИВЫХ, КТО-ТО ПАДАЛ В ОБМОРОК, КТО-ТО ЛИШИЛСЯ РАССУДКА, А КТО-ТО, НАВСЕГДА СОШЁЛ С УМА!!! И скажите мне, скажите, за что на несчастный городок обрушилась ПУТИНСКАЯ КАРА?! За что??! За что??? Власть, Власть, и только ГАДОСТНО-СУЧЬЯ ВЛАСТЬ ДВИГАЛА КАГЭБЭШНИКОМ-ИСЧАДИЕМ АДА!!! И знаете, Анисса, в этих небольших отрывках очень сложно всё рассказать и досказать, я лишь представил толику НАСТОЯЩЕЙ ПРАВДЫ!! До которой, Вам, как до луны пешком! И Вы тут говорили что-то о &quot;СТЫДЕ...&quot; А я Вам тогда скажу; Вы не знаете, что несёт в себе ЧИСТАЯ СОВЕСТЬ, то есть, не замаранная ни разу! О чём у Вас, всё же какое-то понятие есть! И говорю вам прямо: Вы, красивая, Вы, приятная, и глаза у Вас чистые, ясные, лучистые, не бегающие, то есть, не лживые. Не зря, ещё Древние подметили; глаза-зеркало души! И Могу Вас заверить; Вы не совсем Испорченная и Потерянная, просто, в силу неполного знания и своего менталитета, Вы, хоть как, в моём понятие, подходите на сегодняшнюю роль ШАЛАБОЛКИ! И поверьте, я зря ничего не говорю. Но, я в Самом деле увидел у Вас Качество настоящего Человека с большой буквы. Так для этого, сиё &quot;Качество&quot; надо ещё заработать и оправдать! Почему я Вам и предлагаю стать НАСТОЯЩЕЙ ПРОФЕССИОНАЛЬНОЙ ЖУРНАЛИСТКОЙ!! А не той, которой до этого Вы были. У Вас есть серьёзный Характер, с определённой Силой Воли, так и когда понадобиться, Вы, сумеете за себя ответить! Вот почему и предлагаю Вам посетить Беслан, где отдельные люди до сих пор бьются рыбами об лёд, желают добиться ПРАВДЫ и СПРАВЕДЛИВОСТИ!! дабы спросить и наказать Всех ПОДОНКОВ того времени! Увы, на сколь Власть Вероломна, на столь она и Труслива, не даёт и мешает собирать о ней ОБЪЕКТИВНЫЙ МАТЕРИАЛ! Ибо Путин, тогда получит без Шаха, МАТ!! Ведь чем больше будет честных видеоматериалов о Людоеде-Путине, тем больше шансов избавиться России от Пожирателя Человеческих Душ!!  Анисса, и Вам я даю карты в руки,  где выбор уже за Вами! Или Вы в моих глазах остаётесь ШАЛАБОЛКОЙ, или становитесь ПРОФЕССИОНАЛЬНОЙ ЖУРНАЛИСТКОЙ!!! Где  само собой в последнем пожелание Вас будет за что УВАЖАТЬ, если у Вас всё же хватит ДУХУ начать и закончить Ответственное, Нежданное Задание, за что, не сомневаюсь, все жители Беслана будут признательны за Вашу Самоотверженность!! Анисса, если всё же окажетесь на Горестно-Кровавой Земле, то советую обратиться к двум славным женщинам! Это, Сусанна Дудиева и Элла Костоева, которые, несмотря на свои разногласия, хоть как вносили и вносят Громаднейшую Пользу по раскрытию Путинского... ТЕРРОРИЗМА!!! И конечно же, независимо ни отчего, Пострадавшие женщины поставят Вас перед такими ужасающими Фактами, что можете  поневоле оказаться в обмороке. Но Вы, всё же крепкая женщина, почему, я при этом, могу Вам пожелать, ВСЕГО ДОБРОГО!! Саныч.

Особо ярые фанаты Мальцева, ватники и школо-хейтеры сразу идут нахуй.<br /><br />О новом оппозиционере из партии Парнас мы узнали недавно. Главной фишкой во всей его агитационной политике стали резкие выпады в адрес действующей власти и в адрес Путина в частности. Если он не выгоден действующему явно авторитарному режиму, то почему у него дома менты не нашли склады оружия, пол тонны героина, а так же полтора миллиона долларов США, которые он прятал под кроватью? Ответ очень прост, от него не избавились, потому что он выгоден, само его существование идет на пользу кремля. Оппозиционер Мальцев, который добивается импичмента Путина, может в момент президентских выборов оказаться отличный противовесом, защищая интересы обиженых властью граждан, таким образом остужая пукан значительной части населения.<br />     Что могу сказать на счет ноября 2017 года. Не будет никакой революции ахахахахах, сидите учите уроки, юные революционеры. Учитывая то, что нацгвардии официально разрешено стрелять по толпе, массовых и стихийных восстаний против буржуазии с целью свержения капиталистического строя, угнетающего рабочий класс, по всем канонам дедушки Маркса не будет , поскольку массам ссыкотно лезть на пулю, останутся только маргинальные и полумаргенальные активисты свержения власти, которых потом увезут на бобике.<br /><br />Ввиду недавних новостей... Жирик полностью одобрил политику Мальцева и сказал, что поддержит его на президентской гонке (пруфы на политаче). Вот и минус оппонент на выборах, останутся против него только Генка-коммунист, рейтинг которого последнее время значительно снизился за счет смертности бабок и дедов и Миронов, который вообще ни рыба, ни мясо. Недавно по зомбоящику журналистка спрашивала Вовку, каким должен быть будущий президент, на что тот ответил, мол он должен быть не старым и не слишком молодым и т д и т п, таким образом намекая на Димку (хотя может быть Вовка и пойдет на еще один срок). <br />Анализируя эту всю поебень, могу сделать прогнозы на выборы: с незначительным перевесом победит Вовка (Димка) возможно наберет в пределах 40-46% голосов, на втором месте с незначительным перевесом будет Мальцев 40-43%, остальная доля избирателей проголосует за оставшуюся шоблу-ёблу.<br /><br />Подводя итоги, можно сказать, что Мальцев выгоден кремлю по всем параметрам, ибо ввиду его отсутствия на политической арене исчезнет видимость демократии и борьбы за , поскольку все наши госдумовские партии в представлении народа давно уже выглядят как собаки на коротком поводке, а наш пикрелейтед настоящий символ правды и свободомыслия.'),(9783,'sO3yqIRSH6o','Херня немного им осталось до 05.11.2017 Вилы уже приготовлены.'),(9784,'sO3yqIRSH6o','V V V V V V V V V  V'),(9785,'sO3yqIRSH6o','А сколько было криков и истерик, после спектакля, устроенного с задержанием Мальцева в Саратова и этапированием его в Москву.

А в итоге я оказался прав. Тому свидетельство 15 суток. которые дали кремлевскому провокатору Мальцеву. Хотя учитывая его прямые призывы к свержение власти, его вообще должны были давно посадить. Но вместо этого, Кремль продолжает пиарить своего агента Мальцева. Чтобы он баранов повел на убой 5 ноября этого года. Чтобы потом был повод еще сильнее закрутить в стране гайки и покончить со всякой реальной оппозицией.
